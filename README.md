# LC-3 VM in Rust

This repository contains a Rust implementation of a LC-3 VM, which I wrote while following this tutorial (https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/) for doing it in C.

## Running Instructions

An image file containing LC-3 assembly should be passed as an argument.

This repo contains the LC-3 assembly for games of 2048 and Rogue. These can be run by running ```cargo run 2048.obj``` or ```cargo run rogue.obj``` from the project root.

# Demo

The below video shows what playing 2048 on this LC3 VM looks like
